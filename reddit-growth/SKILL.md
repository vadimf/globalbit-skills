# Reddit Growth Skill

Grow any product or service through authentic Reddit engagement. No bots. No spam. No API scraping.

---

## Configuration (Fill These In Before Running)

```
PRODUCT_NAME: "[Your product name]"
PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION: "[One sentence: what does it do and who is it for?]"
TARGET_SUBREDDITS:
  - r/[subreddit 1]
  - r/[subreddit 2]
  - r/[subreddit 3]
INTENT_KEYWORDS:
  - "[keyword or phrase your target user would search/post]"
  - "[another keyword]"
  - "[another keyword]"
```

---

## Non-Negotiables

- Browser/headless workflow only — no Reddit API or PRAW.
- Agent posts directly (not draft-only mode).
- Check subreddit rules before every single post.
- If self-promo or links are restricted: value-only reply or skip entirely.
- Never repeat identical replies across threads.

---

## Persona Consistency

- Maintain one stable Reddit username across all sessions.
- Present as a genuine community member who uses the product.
- Never claim to be a brand rep or support agent unless the subreddit explicitly allows it.
- Keep voice honest and experience-based — not corporate or salesy.

---

## Account Warming (Required Before Any Product Mention)

Before mentioning your product or dropping any links, complete the warm-up phase:

### Warm-up schedule (minimum 7 days)

- Max 3 comments/day
- Zero links
- Zero product mentions
- Goal: genuinely helpful, non-promotional replies only

Continue warming if account karma/trust is still low after 7 days.

---

## Subreddit Rule Check (Before Every Post)

For each subreddit:
1. Read the sidebar rules fully
2. Note whether self-promotion or links are allowed
3. If banned: post value-only or skip that thread entirely
4. If removed by mods: pause that subreddit for 7 days

---

## Comment Style (80/20 Rule)

- **80%** — direct, useful answer to the person's actual question
- **20%** — soft product mention, only when genuinely relevant

Guidelines:
- Answer first, mention product last (or not at all)
- Natural tone — no marketing language
- Never copy-paste the same reply structure twice
- Soft phrasing only: "if it helps, we built X" — never hard CTAs or link dumps

---

## Reply Frameworks (Rewrite Each Time)

### 1) Product recommendation request
- Acknowledge exactly what they need
- Give 2–3 honest evaluation criteria
- Mention your product only if it fits
- End with a clarifying question

### 2) "How do I do X?" question
- Give a real method or approach first
- Suggest a practical starting routine
- Mention product as a supporting tool, not the main answer
- Encourage a sustainable pace

### 3) Beginner / new user question
- Reduce overwhelm first
- Give one clear starting path
- Mention product gently only if clearly useful
- End warmly, invite follow-up

### 4) Skill-building or learning request
- Share structure and cadence
- Mention relevant product features softly if applicable

---

## Red Flags — Do Not Engage

Skip threads that could cause issues:
- Bait, troll, or provocation posts
- Highly polarized debates
- Threads explicitly banning promotional content
- Any post where a product mention would look opportunistic

**When in doubt: skip.**

---

## Frequency Caps (Anti-Spam)

Hard daily limits:
- Max 5 promotional-leaning comments/day total
- Max 2 comments/day in any single subreddit
- Minimum 20–30 minutes between posted comments
- If a comment is removed by mods: pause that subreddit for 7 days

---

## Execution Flow

1. Open target subreddits (from your config above)
2. Scan new + hot posts for intent keyword matches (from your config above)
3. Read the full post and subreddit rules
4. Choose action:
   - Value reply + soft product mention
   - Value-only reply (no mention)
   - Skip
5. Write a unique reply — do not reuse templates verbatim
6. Post the comment
7. Report result (see Reporting Format below)

---

## Safety Guardrails

- No mass posting bursts
- No identical comments across threads
- No off-topic product drops
- Respect mod warnings immediately
- If uncertain about rules: skip

---

## Reporting Format

After each session:

```
posted in X threads
links:
- [comment permalink 1]
- [comment permalink 2]
```

Optional: note any blockers (strict rules, low-intent day, still in warm-up phase)

---

## Out of Scope

- SEO blog creation
- Analytics dashboards
- Reddit API or PRAW automation
- Mass campaigns or competitor targeting
